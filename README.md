# Online Resume

This is the second project in my pursuit of my Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree from Udacity. Following is Udacity's description for this project:

"You'll demonstrate your mastery of the language's syntax through a series of
challenges. Each multipart problem mimics a real-life challenge that front-end
developers face. You'll be required to write clean code and to apply your
knowledge of variables, objects, JSON, functions and control flow to
successfully solve the challenges."
